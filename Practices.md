## Class Practice No.3 Activities and intents
In this pratice we learned how to create an App with 2 activities and pass data from the first activity to the second activity

     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

     when the user clicks the send button in the first activity it will open the second activity with the text: "message recieved"  and the message displayed.

     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

## Class Practice No.4 Implicit Intents

In this class practice we learned how to create apps that will advertise the types of intents and activities that they can handle

the first app creates three intents:
#1 to open a URL
#2 to open a location
#3 to send some text
<img src="/Pictures/Implicit intents 1.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

when the user clicks the "SHARE THIS TEXT" Button the systen gives them the options of apps that can carry out this activity 
<img src="/Pictures/Implicit intents 2.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
when the user clicks the "OPEN WEBSITE" button the URL is opened in chrome browser
<img src="/Pictures/Implicit intents 3.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

we then created an Implicit Intents Reciever app  to open URLS and browse to that address
so now when we click the "OPEN WEBSITE" button the system displays options to complete that task
<img src="/Pictures/Implicit intents 4.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
NB: becasue of locations the location was not able to be displayed 
ie we are in china and google maps dont work

## Class Practice No.5 User Interaction clicable Images 
in this class practice we learned to create apps that incluced clicable images 

the app name is Droid Cafe 
NOTE: when an image is clicked a toast message is displayed based on the image clicked 
<img src="/Pictures/clickable images 1.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

<img src="/Pictures/clickable images 2.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

<img src="/Pictures/clickable images 3.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

When the floating action Button is clicked 
it oens a new activity which is a child activity of the main activity
