Hi my name is Christopher Mignon 
I am a masters student at Nankai University and i like reading, watching documentaries, fishing, skating and bike riding.
I am an educator by profession and it is my hope that after I finish this masters degree I cn become an educational technology specialist and help to devolop software systems to assist in special education.

I hope to learn as much as I can in this course.
